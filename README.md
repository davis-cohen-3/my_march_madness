How to run the code from the terminal:
    - To activate the venv: source venv/bin/activate
    - Now run "python file_path"

Notes:
    - MMasseyOrdinals_thruSeason2024_day128.csv is too large to push to git (atleast for the time being), so keep its path in .gitignore, so we don't push it remote repo
        - example git push flow: "git add ." --> "git rm --cached ./data/raw/mens/MMasseyOrdinals_thruSeason2024_day128.csv" --> "git commit -m 'message'" --> "git push origin main"
