How to run the code from the terminal:
    - To activate the venv: source venv/bin/activate
    - Now run "python file_path"

Note:
    - MMasseyOrdinals_thruSeason2024_day128.csv is too large to push to git (atleast for the time being), so keep its path in .gitignore, so we don't push it remote repo
